# unified-controller-emmc-test
This repository validates deploying eMMC storage on a unified controller combining the car head unit and TBox. Although eMMC is deployed under the car head unit, it must be correctly mounted by the Linux-based TBox after each suspend/wake cycle. It also verifies TBox access to eMMC via Ethernet or other bus interfaces.
