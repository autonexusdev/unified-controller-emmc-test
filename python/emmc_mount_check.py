"""
eMMC Mount Check Script for Unified Controller (TBox + Head Unit)

Python Version Requirement: 3.10 or above

This script is designed to verify whether the eMMC storage has been correctly
mounted in a unified automotive domain controller (combining TBox and head unit)
after each suspend/wake-up cycle.

The script connects to the controller's Linux system via ADB, performs login,
and checks the status of a specific mount path (e.g., /mnt/emmc_mount) using several
Linux commands. Log outputs are saved to a local file for traceability.

Usage:
  - Make sure the device is connected via ADB.
  - Configure login credentials if needed.
  - Run the script after the system wakes up from a sleep cycle.

#   after each suspend/wake-up cycle.
#
#   The script connects to the controller's Linux system via ADB, performs login,
#   and checks the status of a specific mount path (e.g., /mnt/emmc_mount) using several
#   Linux commands. Log outputs are saved to a local file for traceability.

# Function: save_to_log
# Purpose : Append content to the specified log file with separator lines.
# Arguments:
#   content (str): The log content to append.

# Function: adb_shell_login
# Purpose : Connects to the controller via ADB shell, handles login prompts,
#           and executes a set of mount-checking commands. It parses output
#           to determine whether the mount path (e.g., /mnt/emmc_mount) is NFS-mounted.
#           The results are saved to log and printed on-screen.
